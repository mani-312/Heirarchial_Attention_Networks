# Heirarchial_Attention_networks

Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) is a neural network architecture that has been designed to process and understand hierarchical structures in text data. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve analyzing text at multiple levels of granularity, such as document classification, sentiment analysis, or document summarization.

HAN consists of two levels of attention mechanisms: word-level attention and sentence-level attention.

In this repo, HAN is used for document classification of datasets dbpedia and yahoo_answers.
